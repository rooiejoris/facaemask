3d printable facemask, autoclave ready, changable filter

Dentist and CEO of Triadontic contacted ProtoSpace for solving the face mask problem which many dentists have at the moment. The goal is to make a 3D printed face mask to protect better against aerosols. The design is optimized for production on a regular fdm 3d printer, it can be printed in half an hour if needed, where the mask itself can be sterilized in the autoclave.
This is typical a 2nd degree, and maybe 3rd and 4th degree, Covid19 problem. Not the front row.




Materials suitable are among others PP, PC-ABS and Hytrel. The mask uses a small rectangular part as filter. 
The whole concept is designed for 2 stages. Short term, 3d printed parts and cutted pieces of HEPA filter and the key word here is produce for the mass. And long term thermoforming and a ready made sterile filter with the elastic straps on it to hold the filter and the mask in place. In both cases, after use the [small] filter can be disposed and the mask can be sterilized.

Parts needed:
- 1,5 hours max 3D printable mask sterilisable in auto clave
[We already have optimized masks which can be printed in 33 minutes!! with a printfarm of 10 machines, this is semi-mass production, the files is optimized for FDM printers, not only speed but also print/surface quality]
- disposable filter which also functions positioning the mask

Whats next:
short term:
- 3d print masks, model takes 1,5 hour or even faster
- cut filter and use rubber bands

long term
- 3d print custom masks, or thermoform for mass production
- produce sterile N95 triangles with elastic bands attached



Mass producible option:
- the 'tiny mask including straps as a sterile disposable product, ideally setup as quick as possible as mass production. [For the same amount of filter material for a traditional mask, 8-10 tiny masks can be produced]
- mask 3d printed or vacuum formed

In the mean time a shield can be printed to hold the filter:

For the dentists the mask is placed over the surgical mask to prevent skin contact since we don't know the effects on that.
In the current situation the dentists wear surgical mask already, but they don't stop virus parts, [if the mask does not completely seal, then the situation is the same as without mask].

After helping one patient the mask will be sterilised and the filter will be disposed.

Printing the mask is good possible. With 10 machines running 24/7 and a average print/part time of 1,5 hour will be 160 mask a day.
When optimizing to 45 minutes a mask it will be 320 masks a day.
When mobilizing 5 farms it will be 800-1600 masks a day.

Many institutes already have a 3D printer or know other companies with a printer so they can print the masks themselves.


1st degree
nurses and doctors in direct contact with COVID19 patients

2nd degree
dentists, psychiatrist in emergency situations

3rd degree
housekeeping, informal care

4th degree and up is to get the economy going
hairdressers
shelf fillers
pedicure / beauty





How researcher/medical experts can help:
- How can we prove this mask will work?
- What can or should be improved?
- Does it filter enough?

Summary: WHO advice: “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected COVID-19 infection… Avoid touching the mask while using it”. Note that in some places like China people are encouraged to wear masks.

When to use a mask:
If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected 2019-nCoV infection.
Wear a mask if you are coughing or sneezing.
Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.
How to use a mask.
Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.
Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.
To remove the mask: remove it from behind (do not touch the front of mask); discard immediately in a closed bin; clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

# print instructions
The 3mf files contain the print profiles for Cura
There are 2 ways for printing:
- The 'solid' files can be printed in spiralize mode without top and bottom and should take about 0,5 hour
- The 'thin' files can be printed with 2 walls or more. The 'slice magic' here is horizontal expansion to get perfectly 2 walls on every layer wihout travels moves.
(!!for the 'thin' files the shield parts may not fit, working on that!!)
